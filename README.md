# codifying-CPS
Chicago Public Schools (CPS) are the backbone of youth opportunity and intelligence in Chicago. In collaboration with RDCEP at UChicago, I will be course-designing and teaching coding/STEM lessons to curious CPS high school students and teachers. This repository can act as an inspiration or case study for anyone who is looking to 'codify' their local public schools too.
